- ✅ Explicit Binding | It is used to bind the object and method together when there is no relation between the method and the object.
- ✅ The call() method | We can use the call() method along with the function and pass as many arguments as we want.
- ✅ The apply() method | The apply() method works like the call() method, but the difference is we can pass arguments as an array.
