## **üë©‚Äçüíª üßë‚Äçüíª Assignment Tasks**

## ‚úÖ 1. Expian Temporal Dead Zone by creating 3 variables in side a block. Post the code as your answer.

```js
{
  // Variable var:
  console.log("Name is: " + name);
  var name;
  name= "JS";

  // Explanations:
  //GEC
    //CP
      //name: undefined
    //EP
      //FEC for console.log(). at this point console.log("Name is: " + name) is executed and found the name variable as undefined. so no error occurred.
      //name: "JS"


  // Variable let:
  // console.log("Age is: " + age);
  // let age;
  // age = 40;
  // console.log("Age is: " + age);

  // Explanations:
  //GEC
    //CP
      //there is no existence of age variable. Because in case of "let" no memory gets assigned or created for age;
    //EP 
    //console.log() get executed here and a reference error occurred. Here temporal dead zone or TDZ is being happened. TDZ start from line 14 end at line 16. 


  // Variable const:
  // console.log("Salary: " + salary);
  // const salary = 10000
  // console.log("Salary: " + salary);

  //Explanations:
  //GEC
    //CP
      // salary:undefined
    //EP
      //salary = 10000
}
```

## 2. Explain Variable and Function Hoisting with Example. Post the code as your answer.

>The source code gets scanned and allocate memory for the variables and function declarations through a process called Hoisting during the creation phase of global execution phase.
>Hoisting refers JavaScript giving higher priority to the declaration than initialization or invocation.

> #### VAR variable Hoisting  
> While allocating memory for the var variable during creation phase of execution context, the var variable is initialized with a default value `undefined`. That's why accessing var before its declaration doesn't causes any error, instead it returns `undefined`; 

> #### let variable Hoisting
> The let variable also set into memory but javascript engine doesn't assign any value for it, but kept into temporal dead zone. Accessing let variable before its declaration returns a ReferenceError.

> #### const variable Hoisting
> As let variable, Same thing happens for const variable also. But only difference is const needs to initialized with a value while defining it. and const can not be reassign.

> #### function Hoisting
> In the function Hoisting process, function set to memory with the function body or function object. That's why function doesn't have any TDZ. function can be accessed before they appear in the code or their definition.
