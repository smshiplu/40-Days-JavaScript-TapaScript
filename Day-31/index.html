  <h1>Day 31 - 40 Days of JavaScript - Prototype & Prototype Chain</h1>
  <h2>What is the Prototype?</h2>
  <p>In JavaScript, prototype is a mechanism by which object inherit features from one another.
  Every object in JavaScript has a built in property which is called it's prototype.<p>
  <p>The prototype is itself an object, so the prototype will have it's own prototype, making what is called a prototype chain. When we try to access an property of an object, if the property can not be found in the object itself, the prototype is searched for the property. If the property still not found then the prototype's prototype is searched. </p>
